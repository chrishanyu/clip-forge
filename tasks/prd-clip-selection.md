# ClipForge MVP - Clip Selection, Highlighting, and Deletion PRD

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enables users to select individual clips on the timeline, visually highlight them, and delete them using keyboard shortcuts. The selection system provides clear visual feedback and integrates with existing timeline functionality like trimming and dragging. This feature solves the problem of users needing precise control over individual clips for editing operations.

**Goal**: Implement a single-clip selection system with visual highlighting and keyboard-based deletion for the timeline editor.

## Goals

1. **Single Clip Selection**: Allow users to select exactly one clip at a time on the timeline
2. **Visual Feedback**: Provide clear visual indication of which clip is currently selected
3. **Persistent Selection**: Maintain clip selection across timeline operations (zoom, scroll, etc.)
4. **Keyboard Deletion**: Enable deletion of selected clips using the Delete key
5. **Trim Integration**: Only allow trimming of selected clips
6. **Timeline-Only Deletion**: Remove clips from timeline only, not from media library

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a video editor**, I want to click on a timeline clip to select it, see it highlighted, and press Delete to remove it from my timeline so that I can quickly edit my video composition.

### Detailed User Stories

1. **Clip Selection**
   - As a user, I want to click on any timeline clip to select it so that I can perform operations on that specific clip
   - As a user, I want to see a clear visual indication of which clip is selected so that I know which clip I'm working with
   - As a user, I want only one clip to be selected at a time so that operations are predictable and clear

2. **Visual Highlighting**
   - As a user, I want selected clips to be visually distinct from unselected clips so that I can easily identify my current selection
   - As a user, I want the selection highlighting to persist when I zoom or scroll the timeline so that I don't lose track of my selection

3. **Clip Deletion**
   - As a user, I want to press the Delete key to remove the selected clip from the timeline so that I can quickly remove unwanted clips
   - As a user, I want deleted clips to remain in my media library so that I can add them back later if needed

4. **Integration with Existing Features**
   - As a user, I want to only be able to trim the currently selected clip so that trimming operations are precise and intentional
   - As a user, I want selection to clear when I start dragging a clip so that dragging behavior remains simple and predictable

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Clip Selection System
1. The system must allow users to click on any timeline clip to select it
2. The system must ensure only one clip can be selected at any time
3. The system must clear previous selection when a new clip is selected
4. The system must maintain selection state across timeline zoom and scroll operations
5. The system must clear selection when user starts dragging a clip

### 2. Visual Highlighting
6. The system must provide clear visual feedback for selected clips
7. The system must use a distinct visual style (border, background, or both) to highlight selected clips
8. The system must ensure selected clips are visually distinct from unselected clips
9. The system must maintain highlighting during timeline zoom and scroll operations

### 3. Keyboard Deletion
10. The system must respond to the Delete key press when a clip is selected
11. The system must remove the selected clip from the timeline when Delete is pressed
12. The system must clear the selection after successful deletion
13. The system must not remove clips from the media library when deleted from timeline
14. The system must handle Delete key press gracefully when no clip is selected (no action)

### 4. Integration with Existing Features
15. The system must only allow trimming of the currently selected clip
16. The system must disable trim handles on unselected clips
17. The system must clear selection when user starts dragging any clip
18. The system must integrate with existing timeline state management

### 5. State Management
19. The system must track the currently selected clip ID in the timeline store
20. The system must provide actions to select, deselect, and clear selection
21. The system must persist selection state during timeline operations
22. The system must handle selection state when clips are added or removed from timeline

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### Multi-Selection
- Multiple clip selection (Ctrl+click, Shift+click)
- Group operations on multiple selected clips
- Bulk deletion of multiple clips

### Advanced Selection Features
- Selection by clicking and dragging to create selection area
- Keyboard navigation between clips (Tab, arrow keys)
- Selection persistence across different timeline views

### Alternative Deletion Methods
- Right-click context menu for deletion
- Confirmation dialogs for deletion
- Undo/redo functionality for deletions

### Performance Optimizations
- Special handling for large numbers of clips
- Virtualization of selection state
- Complex selection algorithms

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Selection Highlighting**: Use a distinct border color (e.g., blue #3B82F6) or background color change
- **Consistency**: Match existing design tokens and color scheme
- **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast for selected state
- **Subtlety**: Highlighting should be clear but not overwhelming

### User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Selection should be instant on click
- **Clear State**: Users should always know which clip is selected
- **Predictable Behavior**: Selection behavior should be consistent across all timeline operations

### Component Integration
- **TimelineClip Component**: Add selection state and highlighting styles
- **TimelineStore**: Add selection state management
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Integrate with existing keyboard handling

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Add `selectedClipId: string | null` to timeline store
- Implement `selectClip(id: string)`, `deselectClip()`, and `clearSelection()` actions
- Update existing timeline operations to handle selection state

### Component Updates
- Modify `TimelineClip` component to accept and display selection state
- Add click handlers for clip selection
- Update trim handle visibility based on selection state

### Keyboard Integration
- Add Delete key handler to timeline component
- Integrate with existing keyboard shortcut system
- Ensure proper event handling and focus management

### Performance
- Selection state updates should be lightweight
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders when selection changes
- Use existing React optimization patterns

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- Users can select any timeline clip with a single click
- Selected clips are clearly highlighted visually
- Delete key removes selected clips from timeline
- Selection persists during zoom and scroll operations
- Only selected clips can be trimmed

### User Experience Success
- Selection feedback is immediate and clear
- Deletion is quick and predictable
- No accidental deletions or unexpected behavior
- Integration with existing features feels natural

### Technical Success
- Selection state is properly managed in timeline store
- No performance issues with selection operations
- Clean integration with existing timeline components
- Proper keyboard event handling

## Open Questions

### Visual Design
1. Should we use a border, background color, or both for selection highlighting?
2. What specific color should be used for selection highlighting?
3. Should the selection highlighting have any animation or transition effects?

### Behavior Details
4. Should clicking on empty timeline area clear the selection?
5. Should selection be cleared when the user clicks the play button?
6. Should there be any visual indication when no clip is selected?

### Integration
7. Should selection state be preserved when switching between different timeline views?
8. How should selection interact with timeline snapping behavior?
9. Should there be any visual feedback when a clip cannot be selected (e.g., during playback)?
