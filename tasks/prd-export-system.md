# Product Requirements Document: Export System with Progress Tracking

## Introduction/Overview

The export system is a critical component of ClipForge that enables users to render their edited timeline compositions into final video files. This system must provide a seamless, reliable, and user-friendly experience for exporting video projects with real-time progress tracking, error handling, and flexible output options. The system leverages FFmpeg for video processing and provides both a settings dialog and progress monitoring interface.

## Goals

1. **Enable Video Export**: Allow users to export their timeline compositions as MP4 video files
2. **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Provide live progress updates during export operations
3. **Flexible Export Settings**: Support various resolution, quality, and output path configurations
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handle export failures with clear user feedback
5. **Export Management**: Support export cancellation and cleanup operations
6. **User Experience**: Deliver an intuitive and responsive export workflow

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **As a video editor**, I want to export my timeline composition as an MP4 file so that I can share my final video
- **As a user**, I want to see real-time progress during export so that I know how long the process will take
- **As a user**, I want to configure export settings (resolution, quality, output path) so that I can control the final output
- **As a user**, I want to cancel an export if needed so that I can stop long-running operations
- **As a user**, I want clear error messages when export fails so that I can understand and resolve issues

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to see time estimates during export so that I can plan my workflow
- **As a user**, I want the app to clean up temporary files automatically so that I don't have to manage disk space
- **As a user**, I want to retry failed exports so that I can recover from temporary issues
- **As a user**, I want export validation before starting so that I don't waste time on invalid configurations

4. **User Satisfaction**: Export workflow completion without user confusion
5. **Performance**: Export operations complete within reasonable time limits
6. **Resource Management**: No memory leaks or disk space issues after export

## Open Questions

1. **Progress Granularity**: What level of detail should progress updates provide?
2. **Error Categorization**: How should different types of export errors be categorized?
3. **Retry Logic**: What retry strategies should be implemented for different error types?
4. **Output Validation**: Should the system validate output files after export completion?
5. **Concurrent Exports**: Should the system prevent multiple simultaneous exports?
6. **Export Queue**: Is there a need for export queuing or background processing?
7. **Progress Persistence**: Should export progress persist across app restarts?
8. **Export Notifications**: Should the system provide system notifications for export completion?
