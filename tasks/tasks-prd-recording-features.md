### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm run test:run` to run all tests or `npm run test:run [path]` for specific files
- Recording functionality will integrate with existing media library and timeline systems
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Screen recording uses AVFoundation (Rust), webcam recording and preview use Web APIs (getUserMedia)
- PiP recording combines screen recording (Rust) with camera preview (Web APIs) in the frontend
- **Camera Access**: Uses native Web APIs (getUserMedia) with proper Tauri webview configuration
- **Note**: Camera permissions configured in entitlements.plist and tauri.conf.json
