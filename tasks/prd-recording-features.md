# Recording Features - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction/Overview

The Recording Features module adds native screen and webcam recording capabilities to ClipForge, eliminating the need for external recording tools and streamlining the content creation workflow. This feature allows users to capture screen content, webcam footage, or both simultaneously, then seamlessly integrate the recordings into their video editing timeline.

**Problem Solved**: Content creators currently need to use separate recording applications before importing videos into ClipForge, creating workflow friction and requiring multiple tools.

**Goal**: Provide integrated recording functionality that captures high-quality video content directly within ClipForge and automatically integrates with the existing media library and timeline editing workflow.

## Goals

1. Enable users to record screen content directly within ClipForge
2. Enable users to record webcam footage with microphone audio
3. Enable users to record screen and webcam simultaneously (Picture-in-Picture)
4. Automatically save recordings to media library with thumbnail generation
5. Seamlessly integrate recordings with existing timeline editing workflow
6. Provide simple, intuitive recording controls with minimal complexity
7. Ship the feature quickly with essential functionality only

## User Stories

1. **As a content creator**, I want to record my screen while explaining a process so that I can create tutorial videos without using external tools.

2. **As a presenter**, I want to record my webcam with my presentation so that I can create engaging content with my face visible.

3. **As a course creator**, I want to record both my screen and webcam simultaneously so that I can show both my presentation and my reactions in one video.

4. **As a video editor**, I want my recordings to automatically appear in my media library so that I can immediately start editing without additional import steps.

5. **As a user**, I want simple recording controls so that I can start recording quickly without complex configuration.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Recording Functionality

1. The system must allow users to start screen recording by selecting from available displays and windows
2. The system must allow users to start webcam recording with live preview before recording begins
3. The system must allow users to record screen and webcam simultaneously with a combined preview
4. The system must automatically capture microphone audio with webcam recordings
5. The system must provide a visual recording indicator (red dot, duration counter) during active recording
6. The system must allow users to stop recording at any time
7. The system must enforce a maximum recording duration of 1 hour per session

### Device Management

8. The system must detect and list all available displays for screen recording
9. The system must detect and list all available cameras for webcam recording
10. The system must allow users to select their preferred recording device
11. The system must handle device permission requests gracefully

### Recording Quality & Settings

12. The system must record at a default quality setting (no user configuration needed)
13. The system must maintain consistent video quality across all recording types
14. The system must ensure audio and video synchronization

### File Management & Integration

15. The system must automatically save completed recordings to the media library
16. The system must generate thumbnails for all recordings (same as imported media)
17. The system must treat recordings identically to imported media files
18. The system must clean up any partial recordings if recording fails unexpectedly
19. The system must handle recording failures by treating them as completed recordings

### User Interface

20. The system must provide a prominent recording button in the application header
21. The system must show a recording dialog for device selection and settings
22. The system must display a live camera preview before webcam recording starts
23. The system must show a combined preview for Picture-in-Picture recording
24. The system must provide clear visual feedback during recording (duration, status)

### Error Handling

25. The system must handle recording interruptions gracefully
26. The system must save partial recordings if recording stops unexpectedly
27. The system must display clear error messages for permission denials
28. The system must provide fallback options when devices are unavailable

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- System audio capture (screen recording will be video-only)
- Multiple recording quality presets or user configuration
- Recording duration limits beyond 1 hour
- Special visual indicators for recordings in media library
- Advanced audio controls or audio level monitoring
- Recording to custom file locations (always use media library)
- Batch recording or scheduled recording
- Recording pause/resume functionality
- Advanced Picture-in-Picture positioning controls
- Recording analytics or usage statistics
- Cloud upload of recordings
- Recording templates or presets

---

## Design Considerations

### UI Placement
- Recording button should be prominently placed in the application header
- Recording dialog should be modal and overlay the main interface
- Recording indicator should be a floating overlay during active recording

### Visual Design
- Use red color scheme for recording states (button, indicator)
- Maintain consistency with existing ClipForge design language
- Keep recording controls simple and uncluttered

### User Experience
- Minimize steps required to start recording
- Provide clear visual feedback for all recording states
- Ensure recordings integrate seamlessly with existing workflow

---

## Technical Considerations

### Hybrid Recording Architecture
- **Screen Recording**: Use AVFoundation (Rust backend) for native macOS screen capture
- **Webcam Recording**: Use getUserMedia + MediaRecorder API (frontend) for cross-platform camera access
- **Picture-in-Picture**: Combine screen recording (AVFoundation) with webcam stream (getUserMedia) in frontend
- **Audio Capture**: Use MediaRecorder API for webcam audio, AVFoundation for screen recording audio

### Backend Implementation
- Use AVFoundation bindings for macOS screen capture only
- Implement Rust command handlers for screen recording operations
- Leverage existing FFmpeg integration for thumbnail generation
- Use existing file management patterns for media library integration

### Frontend Implementation
- Use Web APIs (getUserMedia, MediaRecorder) for webcam recording
- Implement camera device enumeration and selection
- Handle webcam recording state management in React
- Combine screen and webcam streams for PiP recording

### State Management
- Create new `RecordingStore` using Zustand pattern
- Integrate with existing `MediaStore` for file management
- Maintain recording state separate from timeline state
- Handle both backend (screen) and frontend (webcam) recording states

### File Handling
- Save recordings to same location as imported media
- Use existing thumbnail generation pipeline
- Follow existing file naming and organization patterns
- Handle both backend-generated and frontend-generated recording files

### Performance
- Optimize for quick recording start time (< 2 seconds)
- Minimize memory usage during recording
- Ensure smooth recording without frame drops
- Leverage browser optimizations for webcam recording

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a recording preview/playback feature before adding to timeline?
2. What should be the default recording resolution (1080p, 720p)?
3. Should we implement keyboard shortcuts for recording start/stop?
4. How should we handle multiple monitor setups for screen recording?
5. Should we implement any recording validation (e.g., check for sufficient disk space)?
