## Introduction (15 seconds)

Hello! Today I'll walk you through the technical architecture of **ClipForge**, a native macOS video editor built for speed, performance, and reliability. We've built a production-grade desktop application that enables creators to import, edit, and export professional videos—all with a minimal footprint and blazing-fast performance.

## Core Architecture (45 seconds)

ClipForge follows a modern desktop application architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend.

On the **frontend**, we're using **React 18 with TypeScript** in strict mode for full type safety. For state management, we chose **Zustand** over Redux—it gives us a simpler API with less boilerplate while maintaining excellent TypeScript support. Our build tool is **Vite**, which provides lightning-fast hot module replacement during development and optimized production builds.

On the **backend**, we're running **Rust with Tauri 2.0**. Why Tauri? First, it gives us seamless binary integration—Tauri's sidecar system makes bundling and executing FFmpeg binaries incredibly straightforward, with automatic platform detection and built-in permission management. This is a game-changer for video processing applications. Second, we get native performance with a bundle size under 150 megabytes—compared to Electron apps that often exceed 300 megabytes. Tauri provides a secure IPC bridge between our React frontend and Rust backend, with explicit permissions for everything.

## Media Processing Engine (30 seconds)

The heart of ClipForge is **FFmpeg**, the industry-standard video processing library. We bundle FFmpeg as a Tauri sidecar—meaning we ship pre-compiled static binaries for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. This approach avoids compilation complexity while giving us access to every codec and format FFmpeg supports. 

Our Rust backend orchestrates FFmpeg through the Shell API, handling metadata extraction, thumbnail generation, and video export—all with streaming output to avoid memory overhead.

## State Management & Data Flow (30 seconds)

We've architected three independent Zustand stores: **mediaStore** for imported clips, **timelineStore** for composition and playback state, and **exportStore** for progress tracking. Each store is fully tested with over 150 unit tests covering edge cases and real-world scenarios.

Our data flow is unidirectional: user actions trigger store updates, which re-render React components. When backend operations are needed, we call Tauri commands, which execute in Rust, return results via IPC, and update our stores.

## UI Architecture (20 seconds)

The interface follows a three-panel layout: **Media Library** on the left for clip management, **Video Player** at center for preview, and **Timeline Editor** at the bottom for editing. We're using plain CSS with design tokens—no heavy frameworks needed. Timeline rendering uses DOM positioning with `React.memo` for performance, and we'll migrate to Canvas rendering if we exceed 50 clips.

## Performance Optimizations (20 seconds)

Performance is critical for video editing. On the frontend, we use selective rendering with Zustand selectors, debounce drag operations, and memoize expensive components. On the backend, all FFmpeg operations are async, we stream output without loading into memory, and process thumbnails in parallel. For video export, we use FFmpeg's `-c copy` flag for concatenation—no re-encoding means exports start in under one second.

## Testing & Quality (15 seconds)

We've built **155 comprehensive unit tests** across stores and utilities, all passing with 100% coverage of implemented functionality. Our TypeScript strict mode catches errors at compile-time, and Rust's type system prevents memory issues at runtime.

## Current Status (15 seconds)

The MVP is complete with full import-to-export workflow working. Users can import videos, arrange them on a two-track timeline, trim clips with handles, preview in real-time with timeline sync, and export to MP4 with live progress tracking. 

## Closing (15 seconds)

ClipForge demonstrates what's possible when you combine modern web technologies with native system performance. React and TypeScript give us developer velocity, Rust and Tauri give us native speed, and FFmpeg gives us professional-grade video processing. The result? A fast, reliable, and maintainable video editor that runs entirely on the user's machine—no cloud, no subscriptions, just pure local performance.

Thank you!
