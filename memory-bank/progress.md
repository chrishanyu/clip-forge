## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **FFmpeg Sidecar Integration** 🔴
   - Never done before
   - Tauri 2.0 permission system is new
   - Critical for MVP
   - **Mitigation**: Test by Day 2

2. **Timeline Performance** 🟡
   - Unknown if DOM approach will work
   - Could require Canvas rewrite
   - **Mitigation**: Profile early, optimize if needed

3. **Time Constraints** 🔴
   - Ambitious scope for timeframe
   - Must hit MVP requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, defer non-MVP

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Video Codec Compatibility**
   - HTML5 video may not play all formats
   - **Mitigation**: Test with common formats early

2. **Export Concatenation**
   - Simple concat may not work for all files
   - **Mitigation**: Document limitations, validate inputs

### Low Risk Items
1. **UI Implementation**
   - Standard React patterns
   - Well-understood territory

2. **State Management**
   - Zustand is straightforward
   - Low complexity

---

## Next Milestone: Development Start

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] `npm run tauri dev` launches app successfully
- [ ] FFmpeg binaries configured and accessible
- [ ] First Rust command working (e.g., version check)
- [ ] First Zustand store created
- [ ] Basic app layout renders

### Estimated Time to Milestone
- **Optimistic**: 4-6 hours
- **Realistic**: 8-12 hours
- **Pessimistic**: 16+ hours (if major issues)

---

## Development Velocity

### Expected Pace
- **Setup**: 1-2 days
- **Backend foundation**: 1 day
- **Frontend foundation**: 1 day
- **Core features**: 2-3 days
- **Polish & package**: 1-2 days

### Current Pace
Not started - no velocity to measure

---

## Notes

### Important Reminders
- Test FFmpeg integration EARLY (Day 1-2)
- Build .dmg EARLY (Day 3-4) to catch bundling issues
- Focus on MVP only - defer everything else
- Document issues as they arise

### Lessons Learned
None yet - project just starting

---

**Document Status**: Initial state - ready for development to begin
**Next Update**: After first implementation session
